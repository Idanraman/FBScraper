# FBScraper
a tool to scrape facebook pages, feeds, and groups for posts data and metadata
Using graph API and Python3. no library imports are needed.


main.py can be used for groups.
main_dn.py can be used for pages.

insert a "dataset.txt" file to skip fetching data (should be an outpost.txt file).

# Updates
15.6.19 - As facebook gets more and more annoying, you are now required to have an Access token from a reviewed app to get this to work (otherwise not permitted). Easiest way to get such an app is to buy it on a website like "Upwork".
